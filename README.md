# Pasted

## What is it?

Pasted is a free, privacy respecting frontend for pastebin written in Rust. It is designed to use no javascript and be as simple as possible while also maintaining as many features as possible.

## Future

Currently, the goal is to only do pastebin, but in the future I am looking to make a frontend to all th emajor pastebin alternatives aswell, all in one.

# Pasted

## What is it?

**Pasted** is a free, privacy-respecting frontend for Pastebin, written in Rust. It is designed to work **without JavaScript** and aims to be as simple as possible while still maintaining a wide range of features.

## Self-Hosting

We provide a Docker image! It's available at:
[**ghcr.io/dragynfruit/pasted\:latest**](https://github.com/dragynfruit/pasted/pkgs/container/pasted)

By default, it uses port `3000` and binds to `0.0.0.0`. You can override this by setting the `PORT` and `HOST` environment variables.

A premade `docker-compose.yml` file is available [here](docker-compose.yml).

## Privacy Policy

We do **not** collect any data. However, keep in mind that **Pastebin** might.

## Future Plans

Currently, Pasted is focused solely on providing a frontend for Pastebin. In the future, we plan to support other major Pastebin alternatives as well â€” all in a single interface.
